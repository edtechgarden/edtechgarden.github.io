## Ed Tech Garden

This repository is where we develop the technology education materials for edtechgarden.github.io. Contributions are welcome both on github or just by mailing "ian" at this domain: edtechgarden.org. 

The site is built with the [Pelican static site generator](http://blog.getpelican.com/) but you can also contribute just by editing the markdown files in the "contents" directory. If you want to do local development on the site's html/css, or just want to check how your contributions will look once renendered, all relevant Prelican theme files are also included here. Please make all proposed changes to the markdown files or pelican theme files in the "sources" branch you see here, not to the html output in the "master" branch.
